  <p style="text-align: justify;">To make my life a bit more interesting, my parents- especially my mom ‚Äì decided to enroll me to both the national primary school and religious primary school. I enrolled in both SK Bangsar and SRA Ar-Razi from the year 2011 until 2016.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">My experience in SK Bangsar wasn't that bizarre, at this point in my life, all I could care about was my fictional books and what my friends think about me. In SRA Ar-razi, I am an ordinary student but as the school is a small one compared to other religious schools around us, we all knew everyone in the school including the ustaz and ustazah too. To add a little fun fact, it took me a whole two years to learn the ABC during primary school because I grew accustomed to reading the Jawi script as my grandparent encourages me to do so.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">As per my result, for UPSR I only attained 1A. For my religious school, I got 4As 4Bs for my UPKK and for my UPSRA I got 2As... I think</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Life has become a lot challenging, and I couldn't keep up for the most part. Growing up different from others, I felt no sense of belonging and I wasn't as serious about my future compared to everyone else around this time of my life.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Being only 14 years old, I decided to change that and have a sense of purpose which is to join the School Prefect. Though I had fun and enjoyed being the Prefect, I decided to quit when I got into Form 3. For PT3 I got 1A and the rest is history. Until I got in Form 4 and was assigned to Account Stream. Life went uphill from there and for SPM I got 4As 3Bs 1Cs and 2Ds.</p>
    <img src="photos/4A_sripantai.jpg" alt="Afiqah getting 4A_posing with Diana" width="350" height="300">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I got the Excellence student award. My very first one. After years of seeing people get the award for their SPM result, I finally got my chance to receive it as well. If anything, I am honoured to be able to. I thank myself for being resilience and finally changing for the betterment of myself if not for others.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">I grew; I broke everyone's expectations of me. What's next? After not getting any offer from UPU, I was devastated. Thankfully, I got offered to study in Form Sixth at SMK Vivekananda. I got into the Social Science stream and majored in Kesusasteraan Melayu Komunikatif (KMK) , Bahasa Melayu, Sejarah and Pengajian Am.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">I am also active in terms of extracurricular activities. I joined the editorial club, being the main editor of the school's magazine. I also joined Form Sixth Union Club as a Wellness committee member. In term of my mandatory extracurricular activities, I joined Environmental Club and got appointed as Vice President, Pandu Puteri and Netball as active member!</p>

  </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At this school, I learned to be more sociable, manage people and how to read body language. At this school too, I developed a strong sense of knowledge and made knowledge more accessible. I also like to challenge myself occasionally during form sixth. For instance, I joined the national competition as my school representative for Tug of War competition. We lost but the experience itself makes me feel excited and I get to know a lot of people outside my school.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">In term of academic, fortunately, I can maintain a cgpa of 3.00 per semester. At the end of it, I got an outstanding student award as my overall CGPA is 3.33. I got to bring my mom and my grandmother to sit in the audience watching me getting the award on stage with my friends whom I love. All of the hardships I went through for a year, and a half were worth it as I saw my mom and grandmother smile at me. Not to forget my teachers who always believed in me even when I flopped through my trial exam.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">2024-Present</p>
  <img src="photos/uitm_puncak_perdana.png" height="200" width="350">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">With my STPM Result, I was offered a place at UiTM Puncak Perdana! I am now studying Library Management under the faculty of Information Management. In this course, I learned about technologies in Library and how to incorporate latest technology such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning system (although its not as new now) in library. </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">When I first tell my family and my extended family about this, most of them laughed and told me that it suits me because I am always with a book or reading something randomly. What stood out to me was the encouragement I got from my uncle. My uncle told me that there is probably a <i>hikmah</i> why God gave me this course and that for me to study smart so I can pursue education overseas such as Japan National Library or Libraries in Australia. The sense of hopefulness of my future from his perspective made me more excited to be in this course. </p>

    <img src="photos/friends_collage.png" height="200" width="350">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Long story short, I am finally in my second semester. Which is insane because I thought I was going to drop out in my first three weeks after orientation, but I pushed through because I have a dream and hope to do well in this course. I hope that I am always surrounded by people who love me for me and let me exist but also won't let me abandon my future and dream for something mundane. </p>
