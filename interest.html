    <h3 style="text-align: center;">History</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">History is an interest of mine since forever! I'm a huge geek about the civilisation, the history of individuals and places. My favourite history of individuals includes Hang Tuah, Joan of Arc, Mahsuri, the Sultan of Melaka, Tun Perak and Vincent Van Gogh. As per civilisation, I love the history of Russia, Asia and Roman and Egyptian! For places, I love Melaka, Athens and Langkawi!</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">As for music, I love various of genres. Mainly making the artists my centre attention rather than the genre. I have been a huge fan of BTS since 2016! Liking their music has opened so many doors for me to discovers many talented artists such as Weezer, Tyler The Creator, MF DOOM, Clairo, Hatsune Miku (Vocaloid overall), Twice, and Frank Ocean also many more! Even before I know BTS, I have been such a huge fan of music altogether. I remember being obsessed with the music released by Yuna, Stacy, Najwa Latiff and bunch of songs from my dad's collection.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, I would sit in front of the TV with my family to watch any western or local shows and movies. I remember waiting every week for the new episode of The Walking Dead to be aired in HBO with my family. I guess it stuck with me now as I grew into a person. TV Shows and movies I love are Coraline, Smiling Friends, Chiikawa, The Good Place, Zombi Kampung Pisang. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I also love reading. I've read many books growing up which is funny because if you read my education section, I mentioned that I couldn't write for 2 years of primary school so about 8 years of my life. Alas, my mom teaches me how to read, and I seem to not be able to put it down when I picked it up. My favourite book is spread across genre but main genre I always picked up are manga and fiction- or so I think; which is the 1984 by George Orwell, Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, Look Back by Tatsuki Fujimoto, My Broken Mariko Waka Hirako, Snow by Orhan Pamuk and Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront√´. </p>
